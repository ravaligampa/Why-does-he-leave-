Overview about "Why does he leave" : 
For a sustainable growth of any organization it needs to have consistency source of the resources. These resources can be human resources or non-human resources. Most important of all these resources would be the man power. No organization wishes to lose its talented group. We train our model with human resource analysis data set and predict if the employee is leaving the company. The deciding factors include Satisfaction level, Number of Projects undertaken, Last Evaluation result, Time Spent in the company and many more. Aim is to build a model using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forests  for Prediction about the employee stay in the company. Then find the  accuracy of each model using confusion matrix. At the end, compare the classification performance of the models using ROC curves. Our analysis show that random forest is the most suitable technique for the dataset.
